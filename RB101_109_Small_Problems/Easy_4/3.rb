# Leap Years (Part 1)
# leap years occur in every year that is evenly divisible by 4, unless the year is also divisible by 100. 
# If the year is evenly divisible by 100, then it is not a leap year unless the year is evenly divisible by 400.

def leap_year?(year)
  (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0) ? true : false
