# Getting Things Done
# We wrote a method for moving a given number of elements from one array to another. 
# We decide to test it on our todo list, but invoking move on line 11 results in a 
# SystemStackError. What does this error mean and why does it happen?

def move(n, from_array, to_array)
  to_array << from_array.shift
  move(n - 1, from_array, to_array)
end

# ----- revised version -----

def move(n, from_array, to_array)
  to_array << from_array.shift(n)
end

# Example

todo = ['study', 'walk the dog', 'coffee with Tom']
done = ['apply sunscreen', 'go to the beach']

move(2, todo, done)

p todo # should be: ['coffee with Tom']
p done # should be: ['apply sunscreen', 'go to the beach', 'study', 'walk the dog']


# ----- ls revised sol -----

def move(n, from_array, to_array)
  return if n == 0 # add a return to stop as soon as we added n elements
  to_array << from_array.shift
  move(n - 1, from_array, to_array)
end

# Every recursion needs a base case, i.e. a condition under which it will stop. 
# Our method doesn't have one, so it just repeatedly calls itself with ever decreasing values for n:
# move(2, ..., ...)
# move(1, ..., ...)
# move(0, ..., ...)
# move(-1, ..., ...)
# move(-2, ..., ...)
# ...

# In order to know where it needs to return to after finishing each of these calls, 
# Ruby puts each call on a call stack. Since we never stop, this stack keeps growing and growing, 
# until it exceeds its limit. This causes the SystemStackError - a real stack overflow!
# In order to fix this, we need to add a condition under which the recursion stops.
# We want to stop as soon as we have moved n elements from one array to the other, 
# i.e. when n == 0. The code we have added on line 2 of the solution tells Ruby to 
# return from the method when that condition is met.
