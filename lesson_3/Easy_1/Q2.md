1. what is `!=` and where should you use it?
`!=`: not equal to, you can use it on a conditional clause, or somewhere you want to express that something is not equal to something.

2. put `!` before something, like `!user_name`
It turns object into the opposite of their boolean equivalent, it will return `true` or `false`.
```ruby
a = 5
!a #=> false
```

3. put `!` after something, like `words.uniq!`
When calling a method with suffix `!`, it means this method mutates the original object.

4. put `?` before something
Ternary opretor for `if...else...`

5. put `?` after something
Just a part of the method name, like: `valid_choice?` in RPS homework.

6. put `!!` before something, like `!!user_name`
It turns object into their boolean equivalent, it will return `true` or `false`

```ruby
a = 5
!!a #=> true
```
