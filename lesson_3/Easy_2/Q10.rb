# Back in the stone age (before CSS) we used spaces to align things on the screen. 
# If we had a 40 character wide table of Flintstone family members,
# how could we easily center that title above the table with spaces?

title = "Flintstone Family Members"
title.center(40)
#=> "       Flintstone Family Members        " 
# width in total = 40, with FFM centered and padded with spaces
